# [NeRD++: Improved 3D-mirror symmetry learning from a single image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12579), BMVC 2022. 
This is a follow-up work over [NeRD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03211), which aims to detect the dominant mirror symmetry plane from a single-view image.

Code will be released after cvpr ddl.
